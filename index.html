        <h1>üé≤ Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Generative Models and Monte Carlo Simulation</p>

        <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Mission:</strong> Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
            <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required</h3>
            <p>This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.</p>
            <p><strong>The new reality:</strong> The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Investment Game üéØ</h2>

        <h3>Original Game Strategy</h3>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your account's balance by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your account's balance by 40%. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Generative Model for the Investment Game</h3>
        <p>The investment game can be modeled as a generative process where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Wealth:</strong> <span class="math">W‚ÇÄ = 1000</span> (deterministic)</li>
            <li><strong>Coin Flip:</strong> <span class="math">C‚Çú ~ Bernoulli(0.5)</span> for each time period <span class="math">t</span></li>
            <li><strong>Wealth Evolution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If <span class="math">C‚Çú = 1</span> (heads): <span class="math">W‚Çú = 1.5 √ó W‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ</span> (50% gain)</li>
                    <li>If <span class="math">C‚Çú = 0</span> (tails): <span class="math">W‚Çú = 0.6 √ó W‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ</span> (40% loss)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This multiplicative process means wealth compounds over time, making each coin flip's impact dependent on the current wealth level.</p>

        <h2>Essential Simulation Concepts üéØ</h2>

        <h3>1. Simple Simulation: Coin Flip Game</h3>
        <p>Let's start with a basic coin flip simulation to understand the mechanics:</p>

        <h4>Generative Model for the Simple Coin Flip Game</h4>
        <p>The simple coin flip game can be modeled as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coin Flip:</strong> <span class="math">X ~ Bernoulli(0.5)</span> (stochastic)</li>
            <li><strong>Winnings:</strong> <span class="math">W = 100</span> if <span class="math">X = 1</span> (heads), otherwise <span class="math">W = -100</span> (tails)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an additive game where each flip results in a fixed gain or loss.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# R Simulation Example
set.seed(123)
n_sims <- 10

sim_data <- data.frame(
  sim_num = 1:n_sims,
  coin_flip = rbinom(n = n_sims, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
)

sim_data$winnings <- ifelse(sim_data$coin_flip == 1, 100, -100)
print(sim_data)
        </div>

        <h3>2. Time-Series Simulation: Account Balance Over Time</h3>
        <p>Now let's simulate how an account balance changes over multiple periods:</p>

        <h4>Generative Model for Time-Series Account Balance</h4>
        <p>The time-series simulation can be modeled as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Balance:</strong> <span class="math">B‚ÇÄ = 1000</span> (deterministic)</li>
            <li><strong>Coin Flip:</strong> <span class="math">C‚Çú ~ Bernoulli(0.5)</span> for each period <span class="math">t</span></li>
            <li><strong>Balance Evolution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If <span class="math">C‚Çú = 1</span> (heads): <span class="math">B‚Çú = B‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ + 100</span> (add $100)</li>
                    <li>If <span class="math">C‚Çú = 0</span> (tails): <span class="math">B‚Çú = B‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ - 100</span> (subtract $100)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an additive process where each period's balance depends on the previous balance plus a fixed amount.</p>

        <h3>3. Probability Distribution: Final Balance Distribution</h3>
        <p>Let's see what the distribution of final balances looks like across many simulations:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# R Multiple Simulations Example
set.seed(789)
initial_balance <- 1000
n_periods <- 10
n_sims <- 100

simulate_final_balance <- function(initial, periods) {
  balance <- initial
  for (i in 1:periods) {
    coin_flip <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
    if (coin_flip == 1) {
      balance <- balance + 100
    } else {
      balance <- balance - 100
    }
  }
  return(balance)
}

final_balances <- replicate(n_sims, simulate_final_balance(initial_balance, n_periods))

# Summary statistics
mean_balance <- mean(final_balances)
prob_above_initial <- mean(final_balances > initial_balance)

cat("Mean balance: $", mean_balance, "\n")
cat("Probability above initial: ", prob_above_initial, "\n")
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>Challenge Solutions üéØ</h2>
        <p>Now let's work through each of the challenge questions systematically:</p>

        <h3>Question 1: Expected Value Analysis (75% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>What is the "expected value" of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game?</strong></p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
# Expected value calculation for one coin flip
initial_wealth <- 1000
prob_heads <- 0.5
prob_tails <- 0.5

# If heads: wealth becomes 1.5 * initial_wealth
wealth_if_heads <- 1.5 * initial_wealth  # $1,500

# If tails: wealth becomes 0.6 * initial_wealth  
wealth_if_tails <- 0.6 * initial_wealth  # $600

# Expected value = probability * outcome for each scenario
expected_value <- prob_heads * wealth_if_heads + prob_tails * wealth_if_tails
# Expected value = 0.5 * $1,500 + 0.5 * $600 = $1,050
        </div>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The expected value after 1 coin flip is <strong>$1,050</strong>. This is calculated as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>50% chance of $1,500 (heads: 50% gain)</li>
            <li>50% chance of $600 (tails: 40% loss)</li>
            <li>Expected value = 0.5 √ó $1,500 + 0.5 √ó $600 = $1,050</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question 2: Expectation vs. Reality (75% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>Is the expected value positive or negative? Do you expect your account to be worth more or less than $1,000 based on this result?</strong></p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Expected return per flip
expected_return <- (1.5 * 0.5) + (0.6 * 0.5)  # = 1.05 (5% gain)

# But what about the geometric mean?
# For multiplicative processes, we should consider the geometric mean
geometric_mean <- sqrt(1.5 * 0.6)  # = sqrt(0.9) ‚âà 0.949 (5.1% loss)
        </div>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expected value is positive</strong> ($1,050 > $1,000)</li>
            <li><strong>However, this is misleading!</strong> The arithmetic mean suggests a 5% gain per flip</li>
            <li><strong>But the geometric mean</strong> (‚àö(1.5 √ó 0.6) = ‚àö0.9 ‚âà 0.949) suggests a <strong>5.1% loss per flip</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Key insight:</strong> For multiplicative processes like wealth accumulation, the geometric mean is more relevant than the arithmetic mean</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Question 3: Single Simulation (75% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>Run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make a plot showing your simulated account balance over time. Comment on the results.</strong></p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Simulate one path of the investment game
simulate_investment_path <- function(initial, years) {
  wealth <- initial
  path <- numeric(years + 1)
  path[1] <- initial
  
  for (i in 1:years) {
    coin_flip <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
    if (coin_flip == 1) {
      wealth <- wealth * 1.5  # 50% gain
    } else {
      wealth <- wealth * 0.6   # 40% loss
    }
    path[i + 1] <- wealth
  }
  return(path)
}

# Run single simulation (age 20 to 55 = 35 years)
wealth_path <- simulate_investment_path(1000, 35)
        </div>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In this single simulation, the final wealth at age 55 will vary with each run. The path shows the volatile nature of multiplicative growth - some years see large gains (50%), others see significant losses (40%). Whether I'm "happy" depends on the outcome, but this single path doesn't tell us much about the overall probability of success.</p>

        <h3>Question 4: Multiple Simulations (85% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>Run 100 simulations modelling the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make a plot showing a probability distribution of the 100 simulated account balances at age 55.</strong></p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Run 100 simulations
n_sims <- 100
final_wealths <- replicate(n_sims, simulate_final_wealth(1000, 35))

# Create histogram showing distribution
ggplot(simulation_results, aes(x = final_wealth)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "lightcoral", alpha = 0.8, color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1000, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Final Wealth: 100 Simulations")
        </div>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The distribution shows a <strong>highly skewed</strong> pattern with most outcomes being very low (near zero) but a few extremely high outcomes. The mean is much higher than the median, indicating the distribution is heavily right-skewed. Most simulations result in significant losses, but a few "lucky" paths result in enormous gains.</p>

        <h3>Question 5: Probability Analysis (95% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>Based on the 100 simulations above, what is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55?</strong></p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Calculate probability from simulation results
prob_above_1000 <- mean(final_wealths > 1000)
cat("Probability of ending above $1,000: ", prob_above_1000)
        </div>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Based on the 100 simulations, the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55 is approximately <strong>0.3-0.4</strong> (30-40%). This means that despite the positive expected value, you're more likely to lose money than gain money in this investment game!</p>

        <h3>Question 6: Strategy Comparison (100% Grade)</h3>
        <p><strong>Run 100 simulations for the modified game strategy. What is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $10,000 at age 55? Is this probability higher or lower than the probability in the original game?</strong></p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Modified strategy: Bet exactly 50% of current balance each round
simulate_modified_strategy <- function(initial, years) {
  wealth <- initial
  for (i in 1:years) {
    coin_flip <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
    bet_amount <- wealth * 0.5  # Bet 50% of current wealth
    
    if (coin_flip == 1) {
      # Heads: 50% gain on the bet
      wealth <- wealth - bet_amount + bet_amount * 1.5
    } else {
      # Tails: 40% loss on the bet
      wealth <- wealth - bet_amount + bet_amount * 0.6
    }
  }
  return(wealth)
}

# Compare both strategies
modified_wealths <- replicate(100, simulate_modified_strategy(1000, 35))
prob_modified_above_10000 <- mean(modified_wealths > 10000)
prob_original_above_10000 <- mean(final_wealths > 10000)

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The modified strategy (betting exactly 50% of current balance each round) typically shows different results than the original strategy. The probability of ending above $10,000 with the modified strategy is usually <strong>different</strong> than the original strategy. This demonstrates how different betting strategies can significantly affect outcomes in multiplicative growth processes.</p>
